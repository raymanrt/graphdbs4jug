# Graph Database and OrientDB
## a (short) introduction

This presentation is a brief insight on the Graph Database world as I observed in recent years.

A simplicistic introduction to NOSQL Databases was required, then I tried to explain the [Tinkerpop](http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/) ecosystem. Also if Tinkerpop 2.6 is described I think it's a good way to introduct anyone to the main concepts. In the future more slides may be added, dedicated to Tinkerpop 3. Then I choose [OrientDB](http://orientdb.com/) as example, since it's the Graph Database I used most in the past years. It's quite good and should be considered, also if it's not the most sponsored.

All my examples are written in Java, since both Tinkerpop and OrientDB are written in Java and I think it's the most appropriate language to approach those products.

Forks and pull requests are encouraged, so please consider to improve this code.

Greetings goes to Tinkerpop and OrientDB development teams, to [revealjs](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) which provides the software to presents my ideas, to github which hosts them, to [JUGTAAS](http://www.jugtaas.org/) which encouraged me to write down my experiences, and to all the friends who made me discover new ways to design and implement good software.
